        Hi, thanks for visiting AI Weather Web! This is Yulin Shi. 
        I am an engineer at ARM (a chip company) developing tools/scripts for internal team to improve work efficiency.

        This AI-Weather web provides weather forecast for Austin using neural network model (machine learning).
        The model was developed from scratch without using any ML libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.
        The training data for the model are collected from Austin and its surrouding cities. 
        Using historical data with geometory relationship improves model accuracy.
